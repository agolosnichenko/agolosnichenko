## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a hands-on technical leader with 12+ years building and scaling products across MarTech, AdTech, TravelTech, EdTech, FinTech, and E-commerce.

**Current:** Head of Engineering at [Vacayou](https://github.com/Vacayou) (traveltech) — leading migration from monolith to modular architecture

**Past:**
- Built tech department at **[Artics](https://artics.ru)** (one of Russia's leading digital marketing agencies, $80M+ revenue) from 2 engineers to 12
- Founded an edtech startup [EasyCoders](https://github.com/easycoders-academy)
- CTO experience in adtech/martech

I've architected systems at enterprise scale and bootstrapped MVPs on tight budgets. I know when to over-engineer and when to ship duct tape.

### 🎯 Philosophy

> "Perfect is the enemy of shipped. But shipped without architecture is the enemy of scale."

I believe in:
- Clean code that other humans can read
- Architecture that evolves, not rewrites
- Teams that own outcomes, not tasks
- Decisions documented in ADRs, not tribal knowledge
- Shipping fast, but not recklessly
